Unless the attachment is removed by the judge, the monies will be paid in court and the Princes will be held responsible for the interest, viz : about £100,000 a year. The total amount that is to be paid to the shareholders and holders of founders' shares amounts to about the same sum that the Government claims.</p>

After being sworn they proceeded to view the body at the Citadel, and on their return to court they heard the evidence of Private Alcoyne Bayliss, of the same company, who deposed how the deceased, on receiving a letter from England on Saturday and reading it, appeared depressed and more reticent than usual, and how he found the body near the tennis court with the rifle by the side and marks of blood on the ground, caused by the wound from the bullet, which entered the month and came out at the back of the neck. At this stage the enquiry was adjourned to this morning, for the purpose of hearing medical and other evidence.</p>

It appears that the Turkish central authorities, alarmed by the temporary success of the revolt in the Yemen, and terrified by the reports of certain mischief-makers, who are unhappily domiciled in Egypt, of an impending Arab rising, have for some time past encouraged the local authorities to search houses for arms and seditions literature, to arrest sheikhs and notables, and in short to add fresh burdens to the lives of their subjects. It now appears that the Porte has begun to suspect the reports of its own agents, and an instructive story reaches us from Aleppo which goes far to support our view that the "Nahda Arabiya’’ bogy was used by unscrupulous agents to secure the Acquiescence of a frightened government in their corrupt and oppressive practices.</p>

Leave was granted him and the nervous governor informed the Porte that a terrible Arab plot to seize Aleppo was maturing and could only be checked by prompt and severe measures. He therefore begged to be allowed to seize all weapons and search every house in the town. The Government, which was aware that Aleppo contained large numbers of wealthy merchants, showed a certain reluctance to commence operations without getting further details of the plot. Enquiries proved that the story of the conspiracy was based on the flimsiest evidence ; the nervous Vali was removed and Nazim Pasha, ex-Vali of Diarbekir, rules in his stead.</p>

Among those present we noticed H.H. Prince Aziz Hassan, Rear-Admiral Sir R. Massie Blomfield, K.C.M.G., and Lady , Blomfield, Mr. Freeman, acting British Consul General, and Mrs. Freemau, Mr. Ambrose Ralli, Vice-President of the Municipality, Mr. Critchley, manager of the imperial Ottoman Bank, and Mrs. Critchley, Artin Bey Rizian, and many others of the elite of Alexandria.  During the coarse of the afternoon a telegram was received from H.E. Sir Reginald Wingate Pasha, regretting his inability to attend, and expressing his wishes for an entirely successful afternoon, and Mr. A. Mitchell Innes, Under Secretary of State, Ministry of Finance, also wrote regretting that a previous engagement prevented him being present and wishing the club every success in their meeting. The weather was delightful, but the burning sun was rather trying during the earlier part of the afternoon.  The want of a swimming bath is the more especially felt on these occasions, end we express the hope that at no very distant date the Municipality will make an effort to supply this long-felt want. There are a large number of swimmers and bathers in Alexandria, and during the hottest parts of the trying summer days the luxury of a bath is denied to the many who are unable to afford the time to go out to the covered baths at San Stefano or Mex. As we prophesied, some excellent swimming was witnessed, and so well were the handicaps framed that the spectators were more than once at a loss to distinguish between the winner and swimmer-np. The dock was very effectively decorated for the occasion with flags and, with the gay assembly, presented a very animated scene. Mounted and foot policemen, kindly provided by the authorities, kept the approaches and entrances clear; in fine everything had been most excellently arranged and the organising committee are to be congratulated upon the success with which their hard labour met.  Mr. Walter F. j Sarjeant, chairman of the club, showed himself to be a hard worker and able adviser ; Mr. H. S. Martin, hon. sec., who has devoted every moment of his spare time to the work since his return from leave, must be especially pleased at the reward of success, which was in a very large measure due to him; and we most not omit to mention Messrs. Purvis and Webb, under whose supervision the dock had been prepared to receive the members of the club and their guests. Mr. D. Dampergola's Orchestra helped to enliven the proceedings with a number of selections admirably rendered. But to turn to the sports themselves: these, though not astounding when compared with the world’s records, were nevertheless of a high class and showed what great good the formation of n swimming club in Alexandria had done.  The progress was marked and the performances of the juniors were especially creditable, and pleasing as promising a great future for the club. For event I., which consisted of the four preliminary heats of the 60 yards handicap for H. E. the Sirdar’s medal, seventeen competitors turned out.  In the first heat A. A. Eeclestone and N. W. Ames cameijn 1st and 2nd respectively, in the second heat W. Wood and C.S. Scarth ; in the third E.A. Darton and G. N. Cheeseman, aand in the fourth P.E. Harrison and W. 0. Mace.  Event II. was the 60 yards juniors' handicap for members under sixteen years of age. Five boys competed and the excellent handicapping was shown by the nearness of the race. Harry Ecclestone, a boy only just turned si. years, went off in nob’e style and the plucky little fellow kept his lead to the end amid loud shouts of "Go it, nipper."  W. H. Talbot, however, drew up to the leader very well and was closely followed by C. E. L. Randall, who had to give 85 seconds start to Elsworth, and between the first three competitors there was barely the difference of a "touch." Event III., 60 yards veterans’ handicap for members of 35 years of age and over, was won fairly easily by W. Wood, but only a few inches separated A. Jackman and M. B. Irvin, who came in 2nd and 3rd respectively. The final of the Sirdar’s medal handicap was then swum off, the competitors being W. Wood, G. N. Chessman, P. E. Harrison, N.	w. Ames, C. S. Scarth, E. A. Darton, W.O.	Mace and A. A. Ecclestone. Ecclestone was scratch, conceding seventeen seconds to the limit man, and he won the race in a splendid manner. Starting off with a clean and strong stroke he almost immediately gained ground, and as the winning point was approached he just managed to overhaul Darton. His excellent swim and graceful action excited general admiration, and he was hailed as winner with loud applause. Darton, too, made a splendid fight, gaining second place, and Cheeseman came in a very good third. The juniors diving championship, for which a cup was presented by the hen. sec., followed. The diving which was from 3.5, and 8 feet, was not of an exceptionally high order, but considering the ages of the competitors it was as good as could be expected. Randall secured the cup and Mitchinson and Harry Ecclestone were awarded 2nd and 3rd places respectively. Event VI plunging championship, followed. As in previous years much difficulty was experienced, in marking off the distances but the judge finally placed Ames, A.B. Collier, end Mace.  1st, 2nd, and 3rd in order of the names. The prizes for this event were very kindly presented by the Alexandria Tramway Company Ltd., while the cup was given by the Alexandria and Ramleh Railway Co. Event VIL was a pole watch between the Alexandria Swimming Club and the Eastern Telegraph Company which was very evenly contested, though the E.T.C. had not been been able to practice for the match. The club were the first to score, Darton throwing in with splendid aim very soon after play began. ei d half time was called with the iowe care ab 1 to niL On changing ends the E.T.C. did better and drew even with a good shot from Incledon but only a minute before time. Ecclastone scored for the club and thus secured them the verdict.  A ten minutes interval was then given but was not without some amusement; Mr. Martin, who bad been on dry land all this time, supervising and judging; was suddenly seized with a craving for the water and rushing along the spring board shoved off for a dive with the full force of his fourteen and a half stone; the board snapped and it was only the last fibers of wood which prevented it from accompanying him in his dive; he also gave some neat exhibition dives. The blindfold race insugurated the second half of the programme and afforded endless amusement. Some swam in circles, others returned to the starting point almost immediately, and not a few endeavoured to entangle themselves in tubs bad life-buoys which were placed on one side to await the obstacle race. Collier, swimming remerkably straight, won fairly easily and was followed by Mace and Lovell almost together. The seniors’ diving competition followed this and some very good diving was witnessed.  The winners were, in order, Collier Ecclestone and Darton. The first, two tying for first place, had to dive again, when Collier gained the verdict owing to Ecclestone turning over slightly. Darton was inclined to "buck” but just kept outside the limits of the definition and his neatness obtained him third place. The obstacle race was most amusing and exciting. The competitors had to pass through life-buoys and barrels and over and under poles and some curious struggles were witnessed. Irvin the limit man looked a certain winner but on his return he stuck in a barrel and, being of no slight build, it was with great difficulty that he managed to extricate himself. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places were awarded to Ecclestone, Mace, and Scarth respectively. The Military polo match between teams of the Departmental Corps and Royal Berks was well fought but the former were distinctly superior and won fairly easily by 4 goals to 1. The Royal Berks were rather weakened by the department of their best men for Khartoum but they made a splendid fight against a strong team and there was very little fouling. Each member of the winning team received a money prize. The juniors then “walked the pole" and for this event, Randall secured the only prize. The seniors followed and Collier was the only competitor to take the flag out of its socket and therefore gained the verdict.  When the military tug of war came off it was getting dark. The Departmental Corps and Royal Berks pulled against each other and as in the polo match the former won by two pulls to nil, and this was the concluding event.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>Lady Btomfield then distributed the prizes supported by Prince Azic Hassan, Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield, K.C M.G., Mr Waiter F. Sarjeant, and Mr. Martin, but be before we refer to this part of the programme we must mention that she was presented on her arrival at 4 p.m. with a beautiful bouquet by Mr. Walter F. Sarjeant, and at the conclusion she was asked to accept a very handsome silver card case from the club as a souvenir of the pccassion. After each successful competitor had reveived his reward Mr. Sarjeant made a short speech in which he thanked Lady Blomfield for her kindness and the interest which she took in the club as was shown by her presence there that afternoon at the centre of such a large gathering. H.H. Prinoe Aziz Haasan and Admiral Blomfield were, he said, very welcome guests. To Prince Aziz he had to offer the heartiest thanks on behalf of the club for the generosity whcch he had shown that afternoon in offering a prize for any race next year which the club might choose. It has since been decided that a 220 yards scratch race will be swum for the Prince's prize, which will be a valuable silver cup. Remarking upon the success of the club Mr. Sarjeant mentioned that when it was formed three years ago there was but a handful of members while now they numbered two hundred and seventy. Before the gathering broke up, Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield in a short speech proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. Sarjeant and the energetic committee who had organised the sports and expressed the great pleasure which it bad been to Lady Blomfield and himself to witness the excellent exhibition of the art of swimming which had taken place that afternoon. We must not omit to mention that the chairman of the Club has kindly given a silver cup for the seniors’ diving championship and that the captains of the merchant marine service trading to Alexandria have most generally promised to present a cup for a junior championship to be decided upon later.</p></div>
